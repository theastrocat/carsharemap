# Car Share Map
A machine learning model for creating a heat map of probabilities of where you will find car share vehicles throughout the day.

## Business Understanding
Knowing where you will be in the city at a certain time is fairly common. For example: I want to go rock climbing and know I will be done around 5, but I do not know if there will be a car share opportunity at that time. It would be beneficial to have some sort of information about what your chances are of being able to get a vehicle.

That is what this machine learning model sets out to help solve. To create a method for building a map of predicted probabilities of finding car share vehicles throughout the day for people to utilize.

## Data Understanding
The subject will be localized to Portland, OR but scalable. I will need up-to-date location data throughout the day of car share opportunities.

## Data Preparation
*TBD*

## Model
*TBD*

## Evaluation
Keeping time series data as well as predicted data and seeing how well they align.

## Deployment
A web application where people can go and use the model to look at predicted probabilities. There should be an input for how much area a user is willing to walk for a car.
